// React -> make easy to manage and build complex frontend

// “React is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building fast and interactive user interfaces.
// It uses a component-based architecture, where the UI is divided into reusable pieces called components.
// React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update and render only the parts of the page that change, improving performance.
// It also supports features like unidirectional data flow, JSX syntax, and hooks for managing state and side effects.
// Overall, React makes it easier to build scalable, maintainable, and dynamic web applications.”
